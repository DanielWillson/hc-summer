					<p>Our Full-Stack Development Track will move you up the software engineering ladder in a fraction of the time of a traditional computer science program. You'll learn through fun, challenging, real hands-on projects - no theoretical stuff here. Comparable programs can cost upwards of $10,000 for just this portion of our program. No former computer science experience is required.</p>

								<p>This is an intensive program to turn an individual into a competent, professional software developer. The skills learned in this program will extend far beyond web or mobile development. Trainees learn the ins and outs of the internet, how to design for millions, how to stay up to date with the latest tools, and how to present yourself and sell your ideas. </p>

								<p>This program will include the development of several portfolio-worthy applications. It will ensure a basic understanding of client interactions and consulting. Lastly, you'll be able to take an idea from abstract to implementation in a team environment. It is our aim not only to teach you to make your ideas happen, but also to be both employable and billable as a software development consultant immediately following this program.</p>

					<p>Something we hear a lot at HackCville is that students desperately want to learn about the structure, problems, and possible opportunities in various industries. Thus, every day for 3 weeks, you'll use the afternoons to learn as much as you can from local industry veterans and startups in the Healthcare, Energy, and Food industries. Twice per week, an expert design thinking facilitator will lead deep dives into specific problems or ideas elicited during these sessions.</p>
