					<p>Our Full-Stack Development Track will move you up the software engineering ladder in a fraction of the time of a traditional computer science program. You'll learn through fun, challenging, real hands-on projects - no theoretical stuff here. Comparable programs can cost upwards of $10,000 for just this portion of our program. No former computer science experience is required.</p>

Lastly, you'll be able to take an idea from abstract to implementation in a team environment. It is our aim not only to teach you to make your ideas happen, but also to be both employable and billable as a software development consultant immediately following this program.</p>

					<p>Something we hear a lot at HackCville is that students desperately want to learn about the structure, problems, and possible opportunities in various industries. Thus, every day for 3 weeks, you'll use the afternoons to learn as much as you can from local industry veterans and startups in the Healthcare, Energy, and Food industries. Twice per week, an expert design thinking facilitator will lead deep dives into specific problems or ideas elicited during these sessions.</p>

					<h1>Here's what you'll learn.</h1>
					<p>Launch will teach you to grow an idea into a venture through bootstrapping, customer development, de-risking, and building a network of committed stakeholders. We aim to radically change your mindset to handle the ambiguity of starting any new idea. Specifically, we'll drill down to push ideas created by you and your cohort towards viability. </p>

					<p>You'll leave Launch with a toolkit to start any venture like an entrepreneur. Based on the maturity of your project, you may 1) have the beginnings of an awesome venture you can work on over the next couple years, 2) quit school to start the next Facebook, or 3) have an amazing example of your skills for an employer.</p>
