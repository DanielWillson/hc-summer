					<p>Our Full-Stack Development Track will move you up the software engineering ladder in a fraction of the time of a traditional computer science program. You'll learn through fun, challenging, real hands-on projects - no theoretical stuff here. Comparable programs can cost upwards of $10,000 for just this portion of our program. No former computer science experience is required.</p>

It is our aim not only to teach you to make your ideas happen, but also to be both employable and billable as a software development consultant immediately following this program.</p>
